## ✨ Core Advantages
Compared with traditional document processing solutions, ADP leverages agent technology and multimodal models to deliver higher accuracy and broader document compatibility without data labeling or model training.

1. **Integrated Multimodal Capabilities for Fast Deployment with Zero Labeling & Training**
Combining VLM visual understanding and LLM semantic comprehension, this is the core enabler of zero labeling and training. It eliminates the need for massive sample labeling, repeated model training and manual rule configuration required by traditional tools. You can define extraction requirements in natural language, with no need to set fields one by one or adapt to fixed templates. Only one sample is needed to support new document types, greatly shortening launch cycles and cutting labor costs from repeated iterations. It accurately interprets document logic, hierarchy and business content, and handles complex scenarios including borderless tables, mixed layouts, handwritten text, stamps, watermarks, blurry photos, layered PDFs and scanned files to fully restore original document information.

2. **Unified Model for All Languages, Global Coverage**
There is no need to deploy and maintain separate OCR models for different minor languages. A single ADP model supports over a hundred languages, including Simplified & Traditional Chinese, English, French, languages of Southeast Asia, European countries and mixed-language documents. No extra language packs or dedicated language adaptation are required, fully meeting global document processing demands for domestic and overseas businesses.

3. **Self-learning & Continuous Improvement for Better Accuracy Over Time**
Built on a brand-new agent architecture, ADP supports fully automated optimization. The system automatically records all recognition errors, learns and adjusts itself continuously, then presents optimized results. Users only need to decide whether to apply the updates. No manual labeling or retraining is required, solving the issue of static traditional models that fail to adapt to document format changes.

4. **Low Learning Curve, Plug-and-Play with Skills**
Easy to get started with no complicated operations. Equipped with built-in Skills for plug-and-play use. Featuring conversational workflow, simply tell the ADP agent your requirements, and it will automatically arrange and generate complete workflows without manual intervention.


## ⚖️ ADP vs Traditional OCR/IDP: Core Differences
A full comparison in working mechanism, deployment cost, compatibility and iteration mode shows that ADP is a comprehensive upgrade over traditional document processing solutions:

| Comparison Dimension | Traditional OCR/IDP Solutions | ADP Agentic Document Processing Solution |
|:---|:---|:---|
| **Core Working Logic** | Mechanical character recognition + fixed rule-based field extraction; only identifies text coordinates without understanding business semantics | In-depth semantic understanding + goal-driven agent execution; comprehends document structure and business logic to complete processing tasks autonomously |
| **Deployment Barrier** | High threshold; requires extensive sample labeling, manual field configuration, rule writing and model training & iteration | Low threshold; no labeling or training needed. Configure requirements via natural language for immediate launch |


## 🏗️ Brand-new ADP Product Architecture: Resolve Complex Document Issues from Point to Whole

ADP adopts a three-tier progressive architecture to manage the full lifecycle of document processing on one single platform, ranging from basic single-field extraction to enterprise-wide end-to-end automation and long-term capability accumulation.

| Tier | Positioning | Business Example |
|:---|:---|:---|
| 🎯 **Point: Basic Parsing & Extraction** | "Understand documents and extract fields accurately", supporting structured processing of single documents such as invoices, orders and contracts | Extract amount, date and supplier information from overseas invoices in one go |
| 📈 **Line: End-to-end Document Workflow** | Connect multiple steps including verification, calculation and format conversion into automated workflows | Full workflow: Invoice extraction → Contract matching → Amount verification → ERP data synchronization |
| 🔁 **Surface: Human-machine Collaborative Iteration** | Manual review and correction drive continuous learning and optimization to form a data flywheel | After several corrections on amount formats, the system automatically adapts to decimal notation on Italian invoices and becomes increasingly accurate |

> Core Value: Realize ad-hoc single-field extraction, enterprise-wide end-to-end automation and long-term exclusive capability accumulation all on one platform.


# 🛠️ Introduction to ADP Skills
This skill calls capabilities via the official ADP CLI tool. Agents can complete calls with simple commands instead of connecting to APIs or writing complex interactive codes. Compared with API-based skills, CLI avoids cumbersome work including interface debugging, data assembly and logic coding, simplifies integration and enables various agents to quickly invoke document processing capabilities.
